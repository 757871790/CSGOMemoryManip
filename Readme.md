# CSGOMemoryManip

This was my first venture into the Windows.h API and basic memory manipulation. The program injects intself into the CSGO process and edits the "glow" struct in memory to allow the player to see through walls.

**Disclaimer:** Not intended for use in competitive CSGO games!

I apologize for the total lack of any documentation in this project. My aim was to challenge myself to finish this project as fast as possible.
